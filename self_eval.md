# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? This was tricky. There was just a lot going on, things all over the screen.  Took me a second to figure out.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?   I honestly have not been taking good notes, I will start ASAP
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I looked over the notes thoroughly and repeatedly, and then I grinded it out.
